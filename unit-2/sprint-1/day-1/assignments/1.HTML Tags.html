<h1> b tag </h1>
<p>
    The b HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface.
    <p> Ex - To get what we have never had <b class="keywords">we must do,</b>what we have never done.</p>
</p>

<h1>i tag</h1>
<p>
    The i HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the i naming of this element.
    <p> Ex - To get what we have never had <i class="latin">we must do,</i>what we have never done.</p>
</p>

<h1> u tag </h1>
<p>
    The u HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be altered using CSS.
    <p> <b class="keywords">Warning:</b> This element used to be called the "Underline" element in older versions of HTML, and is still sometimes misused in this way. To underline text, you should instead apply a style that includes the CSS text-decoration property set to underline.</p>
    <p> Ex - To get what we have never had <u class="keywords">we must do,</u>what we have never done.</p>
</p>

<h1> select tag </h1>
<p>The select HTML element represents a control that provides a menu of options.</p>
    <p> The select element has some unique attributes you can use to control it, such as multiple to specify whether multiple options can be selected, and size to specify how many options should be shown at once. It also accepts most of the general form input attributes such as required, disabled, autofocus, etc.</p>
    <p> Ex - <select name="Choice">
        <option value="first">Iphone</option>
        <option value="second">Redmi</option>
        <option value="third">Vivo</option>
    </select></p>

 
<h1> button tag </h1>
<p>
    The button HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs an action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog.
    <p> Ex - <button name="button">Submit</button> </p>
</p> 


<h1> hr tag </h1>
<p>
    The hr HTML element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.
    <p>Ex - Question 1: what is js? </p> <hr> <p> Question 2: what is Html? </p>
</p>


<h1> br tag </h1>
<p>
    The br HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.
    <p> Ex - To get what we have never had <br> <b class="keywords">we must do,</b> <br> what we have never done.</p>

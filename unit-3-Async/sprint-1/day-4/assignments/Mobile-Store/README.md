## Description

### Note : Use only `textContent` to append the data to the DOM

Create a virtual mobile store system where a user can add products on one page, maintain the data in local storage and and see list of products on a different page. The user should also be able to delete any product, and sort on the basis of price from the list

- index.html

  - A navbar needs to be present at the top to navigate among index page and store page
  - Create a form and it should have an id `mobile_form`
  - it should have the following input fields and corresponding ids
    - name - `mobile_name`
    - brand - `mobile_brand`
    - price - `mobile_price`
    - image - `mobile_image`
  - input for button with type as `submit`
  - on submitting the from invoke the `getInputData` function (make sure you are using event.preventDefault() to prevent the default behaviour of the form)
  - Also, the input tags values should become null as soon as form is submitted. (reset the form)
  - Complete the `getInputData` function to get the data and then invoke `addData` function with name, brand, price, and image as arguments.
  - `addData` function should take the form data and store the data in local storage as array of items with key `mobile_data`
  - follow the below schema to store the data in local storage
    ```
    {
     name
     brand
     price
     image
    }
    ```
    ### This is how the Home page looks like

- store.html

  - This page should show all the products present from the local storage. (complete the `append` function to achieve this)
  - The products should appended to the div with id = `mobile_list`
  - Each product itself should have a container div with class = `mobile`
  - The `append` function should accepts the data as parameter rather than retrieving it inside the function
  - The user should be able to remove products. (send index of the product added to identify which product needs to be deleted)
  - The `remove` function will accepts the index of the items that needs to be deleted as parameter
  - The user should be able to sort the data displayed on DOM by clicking on `High to Low` , and `Low to High` buttons respectively
